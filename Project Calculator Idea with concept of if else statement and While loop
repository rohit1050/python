// Krishna is working on the project Calculator idea that will cover all the basic concept regarding
if else statement and while loop. The Calculator will start by asking what the user want to do
addition , multiplication subtraction and division.

Based on above module the script will either add, sub, mul, div the numbers that are entered. Once
Operation is completed it should ask the user its choice. If the user choose exit the program will
stop //


a=int(input("enter the a value:\n"))
b=int(input("enter the value of b:\n"))
choice=input("enter the your choice for operation\n")
while True:
    if choice=="add":
        print(a+b)
        if choice=="stop":
            break
        else:
            choice=input("enter the your choice for operation\n")
    elif choice=="sub":
        print(a-b)
        if choice == "stop":
            break
        else:
            choice = input("enter the your choice for operation\n")
    elif choice=="mul":
        print(a*b)
        if choice == "stop":
            break
        else:
            choice = input("enter the your choice for operation\n")
    elif choice=="div":
        print(a//b)
        if choice == "stop":
            break
        else:
            choice = input("enter the your choice for operation\n")
    elif choice=="exit":
        break
